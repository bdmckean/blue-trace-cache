# blue-trace-cache


This is a project to write a cache simulator

The project will have two phases

Phase 1
- Build a simulator that will read trace files and a cache configuration file
-- The simulator will generate a report of hits and misses
- Build a set of test traces that will be used to test the fucntion of the cache
-- Some of the test traces will be manually generated to test a specific sequence of IO
-- Some of the test traces will be generated with a script 
---- This will generate some large traces


Phase 2
- Modify the cache simulator to cache objects
- Create a set of test traces that will test the fucntion of the cache
